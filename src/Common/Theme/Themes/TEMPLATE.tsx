// The following file is a template for making themes

// First, import the compiled bootstrap theme file (if you made your own, place it in the CSS folder in the parent directory)
import "bootswatch/dist/flatly/bootstrap.min.css";

// Then, create a dummy function that returns a fragment
function TEMPLATE() {
    return <></>;
}

// Finally, export the function
export default TEMPLATE;

// You'll also need to register this theme in the ThemeManager.tsx file
